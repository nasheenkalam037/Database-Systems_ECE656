Part 1: Baseball Data: Sean Lahman has created a sizable database of baseball statistics, with a
detailed description here: http://seanlahman.com/files/database/readme2016.txt. The data at that
site is available in two forms, CSV files and .sql, though we will provide local copies as
necessary. This database comprises 27 tables, with some tables having over 100,000 rows, and
more than 20 columns. For this initial lab, you will begin to familiarize yourself with this
dataset.

1. Create SQL queries to answer the following questions:
(a) How many players have an unknown birthdate?

- 449

(b) Are more players in the Hall of Fame dead or alive? (Output the number alive minus the
number dead)

- Alive minus death : '-1699'
So, more people in hall of fame is dead than alive.

(c) What is the name and total pay of the player with the largest total salary?

- 'Alexander Enmanuel Rodriguez', '398416252'

(d) What is the average number of Home Runs a player has?

- '2.8136'

(e) If we only count players who got at least 1 Home Run, what is the average number of Home
Runs a player has?

- '7.2428'

(f) If we define a player as a good batter if they have more than the average number of Home
Runs, and a player is a good Pitcher if they have more than the average number of ShutOut
games, then how many players are both good batters and good pitchers?

- 7
